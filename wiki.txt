Edit







This is a list of American comedy films.
Comedy films are separated into two categories: short films and feature films.  Any film over 40 minutes long is considered to be of feature-length (although most feature films produced since 1950 are considerably longer, those made in earlier boom quently ranged from little more than an hour to as little as four reels, which amounted to about 44 minutes).
